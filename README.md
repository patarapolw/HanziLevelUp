# Hanzi LevelUp

A Hanzi learning suite, with levels based on [Hanzi Level Project](https://hanzilevelproject.blogspot.com/#!), i.e. another attempt to clone WaniKani.com for Chinese.

## Features

Tested on Mac:

- Speak sentences and vocabularies when clicked on.
    - May need to be modified to `google_speech` (with `sox`) if you want it to be spoken on non-mac.

## Installation and Get-it-running

- Clone the project from GitHub.
- Change the directory to the project folder.
- `pip install pipenv`, `pipenv --three`, `pipenv shell` and `pipenv install`.
- Run `app.py`.
